The program does compile, but only for a few of the commands.

Most of the methods have been completed and should be working, to my knowledge.

The following methods are the ones that are not complete:

- setFinalGrade in Registry.java


The following commands are incomplete in StudentRegistrySimulator.java:

- PGR
- PSC
- PST
- SFG
- SCN
- SCI
